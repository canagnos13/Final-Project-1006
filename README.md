The following git repository leads to a folder with app.py, and separate folders called "static" and "templates," which allow the user to 
access a website that I've created.
- templates contains index.html, which leads the main page of my website (with a picture and background information), 
  1006.html, which contains a list of projects I've completed in 1006, and classes.html, which gives and overview
  of the classes I've taken this year. Both 1006.html and classes.html are linked in index.html (along with my favorite website)
- static contains an "images" folder with the image used in the main page of my website.
